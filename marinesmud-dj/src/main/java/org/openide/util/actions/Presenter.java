/** Provides a presentation feature for an action.
* Each {@link SystemAction action} that wants to offer a kind of presentation of itself
* to the user should implement one of the inner interfaces.
* <P>
* For example to be presented in popup menu, an action should
* implement {@link Presenter.Popup}.
* <p> Normally actions should implement both {@link Presenter.Menu} and
* {@link Presenter.Popup} together and return the same menu item for each.
* <p><em>Note:</em> implementing these interfaces yourself means that you want to
* provide some sort of unusual display format, e.g. a submenu!
* Most people will simply want to use a subclass of {@link CallableSystemAction}
* and use the default implementations of all three interfaces, according to
* {@link SystemAction#getName} and {@link SystemAction#iconResource}.
